						<h2>Six years ago, on 25 September 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called on the country to join hands for a ‘Clean India’. 
						<br>Many organisations received a request from the Prime Minister’s Office to join the movement and “sweep the streets clean every Sunday for the next five years”.</h2>

						Among those who took the initiative seriously are the <strong>Volunteers</strong> 
						<br>who has not only heralded a cleanliness ‘revolution’ but also altered the visual landscape of the city.

										<strong style="color:green;">V-WILL.org</strong> provides such a platform where cleanups are organized by a variety of third party partners, non-profits, local businesses or individual volunteer leaders in & around Mangalore.
